## Overarching questions

-   Realised productivity of HCWs exceeds theoretical productivity, given expectations about the length of a health appointment. 
-   Are specific aspects of care being routinely missed?
-   Focusing on antenatal consultations (ANC),
       - what are they key determinants of ANC duration?
       - which steps of a standard ANC are being missed?

## Benin: facility 'busy-ness'

- Facility catchment population
- Total attendance in 2009 (stratified by age-groups)
- New patients in 2009 (total/female/pregnant/under-5s)
- ANC visits in 2009
- Number of births in 2009
